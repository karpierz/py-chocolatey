Outdated Command

Returns a list of outdated packages.


Usage

    choco outdated [<options/switches>]

Examples

    choco outdated
    choco outdated -s https://somewhere/out/there
    choco outdated -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass

If you use `--source=https://somewhere/out/there`, it is
 going to look for outdated packages only based on that source, so
 you may want to add `--ignore-unfound` to your options.

NOTE: See scripting in the command reference (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

Enhanced:
 - 0: no outdated packages
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred
 - 2: outdated packages have been found

NOTE: If you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' turned on,
 then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.
