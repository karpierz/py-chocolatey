Info Command

Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote and provide
 detailed information about that package. This is a synonym for
 `choco search <pkgname> --exact --detailed`.


Usage

    choco info [<options/switches>]

Examples

    choco info chocolatey
    choco info googlechrome
    choco info powershell

NOTE: See scripting in the command reference (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

Enhanced:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred
 - 2: no results (enhanced)

NOTE: If you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' turned on,
 then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.
